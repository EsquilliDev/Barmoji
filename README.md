# Barmoji

Barmoji adds a selectable emoji view between the globe and dictations buttons on iPhone X's.

This is how Apple should have used the extra space on the iPhone X keyboard instead of the empty space they went with.

### Installing

Barmoji is not currently available on a Cydia repo yet. When Cydia is updated to support iOS 11 I'll submit to BigBoss as usual. For now, if you're feeling adventourous, use the dylib provided in the release tab with Electra.

### Changelog

1.0
 - Initial Release

### Compiling

Full source will be provided once iOS 11 gets a full Cydia release
