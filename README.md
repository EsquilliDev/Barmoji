# Barmoji

Barmoji adds a selectable emoji view between the globe and dictations buttons on iPhone X's.

This is how Apple should have used the extra space on the iPhone X keyboard instead of the empty space they went with.

### Installing

Barmoji is not currently available on a Cydia repo yet. When Cydia is updated to support iOS 11 I'll submit to BigBoss as usual. For now, if you're feeling adventourous, use the dylib provided in the [Barmoji.zip](https://github.com/CPDigitalDarkroom/Barmoji/releases) with Electra.

### Changelog

1.0 Beta 2
 - Fix Barmoji being displayed when the keyboard is initially displayed in landscape.

1.0 Beta 1
 - Initial Release

### Compiling

Full source will be provided once iOS 11 gets a full Cydia release
